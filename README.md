# DSFrame2D
This is a desktop application for analysing 2D framed structures and calculating mode shapes.

Download: https://sourceforge.net/projects/dsframe2d/

Easy-to-use GUI that provides the possibility to design the structure very fast.  
It calculates reaction forces, diagrams of axial and shear forces, diagrams of bending moment, as well as, mode shapes of the structure using various methods

The program is written in FORTRAN90 and the GUI in Python. At the moment it is available only in 64bit version for windows.  

Features: 
Linear Static analysis,
Direct Stiffness Method, 
Calculation of mode shapes using: Jacobi method or Subspace iteration method, 
Loads: on nodes,on elements, distributed, temperature loads, support dispacement 
User friendly graphical interface 
Upcoming: elastic support, internal releases
